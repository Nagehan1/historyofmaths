    <h1>History of geometry</h1>
    <p class="paraa1"><strong>Geometry</strong> (from the Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- "earth", -metron "measurement") arose as the field of knowledge
    dealing with spatial relationships. Geometry was one of the two fields of pre-modern mathematics, the other being the
    study of numbers (arithmetic).
    
    Classic geometry was focused in compass and straightedge constructions. Geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, who
    introduced mathematical rigor and the axiomatic method still in use today. His book, The Elements is widely considered
    the most influential textbook of all time, and was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th
    century.[1]
    
    In modern times, geometric concepts have been generalized to a high level of abstraction and complexity, and have been
    subjected to the methods of calculus and abstract algebra, so that many modern branches of the field are barely
    recognizable as the descendants of early geometry. (See Areas of mathematics and Algebraic geometry.)</p>
